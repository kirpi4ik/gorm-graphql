# Gorm GraphQL
## An automatic GraphQL schema generator for GORM
Original code of this project you can find [here](https://github.com/grails/gorm-graphql). Original project was outdated for more than 2 years without merging open PRs which unfortunatiley makes that repository useless.
 
The main purpose :
 - Keep grails and graphql dependencies up to date
 - Push the latest version to the maven central

### Dependencies
